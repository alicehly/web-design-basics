			<h2>Develop your idea</h2>
			<p>My "portfolio" website will be a destination for collaborators to contact me for projects. It will also be a platform where all of my published works will be accessible for viewing, rather than having my name spread out amongst different platforms. The space should serve as a platform for my collaborative projects and articles are accessible. Since my work is mostly published on other journalistic platforms and mostly written text, I would like the design to stick to a minimalist style.
			<h2>Persona of Target Audience:</h2> 
			<p>My target audience should be my readers and current and future collaborators. The design should stick to a minimalist style to balance the designs of multimedia stories.</p>
			<h2>Intent and voice</h2>
			<p>To create a space where my work is easily accessible, readable, and easy on the eyes for the user. IT should be a convincing space where my professional persona is convincing and an easy place to reach me.</p>
			<h2>Inspiration and Research</h2>
